This repository is a personal project to help better track my family's primary checking account balance.

I found most budget tracking tools were only focused on past spending habits while I wanted a tool that allowed for projecting a balance months into the future.

This application allows the user to supply a current account balance along with transactions that are credited or debited against that account. 
It lets you designate the transaction as one-time, or recurring. It also gives options for the recurring transaction to be monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly.

It also lets you share a budget with another user, so that each of them may interact with the information as well as a feature that logs and displays any changes made to the models.



This application primarily relies on Laravel blade pages and is very basic, but it accomplished my goal and provides a simple way to monitor a balance in one account.
